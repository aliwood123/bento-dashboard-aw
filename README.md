# Mindful Dashboard

## Why? 
* Introductiont to core JavaScript concepts
* Explore JavaScript Date objects
* Manipulate the DOM nodes with dynamic content
* Apply CSS styling to dynamic data
* Explore pro/cons of JS libraries, plugins, frameworks, etc.

## About
* Visiting Maui is one of the most peaceful times of the year for me. I wanted my dashboard to evoke the calming rhythm of the ocean waves while reflecting some of the colors of the tropical flora you'll find on the island.
